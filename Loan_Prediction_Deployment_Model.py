When applying for a loan, sometimes we get the anxiety of not knowing whether the loan is going to be approved or not.This project is 
intended to help someone understand what factors tends to affect their loan status and probability of their loan being approved

st.write("""**Objective**\n
The aim of this project is to come up with a model that can be used to predict and make the decision of whether a 
loan application should be approved or rejected based on the various features selected\n
I used this dataset because of the various features that it has that I believe has a relationship with the loan 
status. The Dataset is obtained from Kaggle link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/architsharma01/loan-approval-prediction-dataset ,
this includes columns like""",list(df.columns))

- Does credit score have a relationship with the loan approval?
- Is there a relationship between income level, loan status, and credit score?
- Do factors like the number of dependents, education level, and self-employment relate to credit 
score and loan approval?
- What is the average loan-to-income ratio? Does the loan-to-income ratio influence the loan approval status?
- Does the loan term and amount (conditional probability) affect the approval status?
- Is there a relationship between the asset value and a personâ€™s self-employment status, income, and loan amount? 
- Does an individual's asset value affect their loan status

st.write("""**RESULT**\n
During the analysis, I utilized various statistical modeling analysis techniques such as ANOVA and T_Test.

st.write("One of the factors affecting the loan status is:")

st.write("""***1. Loan Term***\n
From the data we have used for the analysis, we can see that the loan term has a slight influence over loan approval. 
It shows that people who want to pay back their loans in less than 8 years tend to have a better chance of being 
accepted for the loan. This is because a shorter waiting period reassures the lender that the loan will be repaid 
quickly with some interest.However, choosing a shorter loan term does not guarantee approval, and a longer loan 
term does not guarantee rejection. This is illustrated in the graph below.

According to how credit scores are calculated, people with higher credit scores show a higher likelihood of 
repaying their loans, thereby being considered creditworthy. A credit score above 600 is generally considered good, 
with scores ranging from 600 to 850, where 850 is the maximum credit score. People with lower credit scores, below 
500, tend to have a higher chance of their loans not being approved. This is illustrated in the box plot below.

This is the ratio of the annual income over the loan amount one is requesting for. As much as loan amount and 
someones income doesn't display a relationship with the loan status, this ratio tends to show that someones loan 
amount to income ratio have an implication over the amount of money one is intending to borrow. This can be because
